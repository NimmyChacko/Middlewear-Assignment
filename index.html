    <p><h4>What Is Middleware? </h4> 
        A request handler with access to the application's request-response cycle is known as middleware. It's a function that holds the request object, the response object, and the middleware function. Middleware can also send the response to the server before the request.
        <h4>Functions of Middleware</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Executes any code</li>
            <li>We can make changes to the request-response objects</li>
            <li>Middleware can also End the request-response cycle</li>
            <li>Middleware can call the next middleware function in a stack </li>
        </ul>
    
        We use these functions to modify our middleware to perform many tasks. If we want to block our site for some country or if we're going to check the authentication of a user etc., we use middleware for that.
        
        
       <h4> What app.use() do in our Express app?</h4>
        An Express application can use 5 different types of middleware. The .use() method in the express is an Application-level middleware.
        syntax: app.use(path, middleware function/s)
        An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls. 
        
        <h4>Types of Middlewares in express:</h4>
        These are all 5 different middleware of an express application.
        	<h4>Application-level middleware.</h4>
        	<h4>Router-level middleware.</h4>
        	<h4>Error-handling middleware.</h4>
        	<h4>Built-in middleware.</h4>
        <h4>Third-party middleware.</h4>

         <h3>Examples:</h3> 
        <h4>Application-level middleware</h4>
        app.use((req, res, next) => {<br>
          console.log('Time:', Date.now())<br>
          next()<br>
        })<br>
        <h4>Router-level middleware</h4>
        Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router()<br>
        const express = require('express')<br>
        const app = express()<br>
        const router = express.Router()<br>
        
        // a middleware function with no mount path. This code is executed for every request to the router<br>
        router.use((req, res, next) => {<br>
          console.log('Time:', Date.now())<br>
          next()<br>
        })<br>
        
        // a middleware sub-stack shows request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path<br>
        router.use('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {<br>
          console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl)<br>
          next()<br>
        }, (req, res, next) => {<br>
          console.log('Request Type:', req.method)<br>
          next()<br>
        })<br>
        
        // a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path<br>
        router.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {<br>
          // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next router<br>
          if (req.params.id === '0') next('route')<br>
          // otherwise pass control to the next middleware function in this stack<br>
          else next()<br>
        }, (req, res, next) => {<br>
          // render a regular page<br>
          res.render('regular')<br>
        })<br>
     <h4>   Error-handling middleware</h4>
        Define error-handling middleware functions in the same way as other middleware functions, except with four arguments instead of three, specifically with the signature (err, req, res, next):<br>
        app.use((err, req, res, next) => {<br>
          console.error(err.stack)<br>
          res.status(500).send('Something broke!')<br>
        })<br>
        <h4>Built-in middleware</h4>
        Express has the following built-in middleware functions:<br>
        app.use(express.static())                           <br>               // serves static assets such as HTML files, images, and so on <br>
          app.use(express.json()) <br>                                           // parses incoming requests with JSON payloads. <br>
          app.use(express.urlencoded())<br>                                      // parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads. 
        <h4>Third-party middleware</h4>
        you can install the node.js module for the required functionality, then load it in your app at the application level or at the router level.<br>
        const express = require('express')<br>
        const app = express()<br>
        const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser')<br>
        
        // load the cookie-parsing middleware<br>
        app.use(cookieParser())<br>
        
        </p>
